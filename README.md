## Mall Customer Segmentation

This project demonstrates the use of the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment mall customers into distinct groups. The objective is to analyze customer behavior based on their provided attributes such as age, annual income, and spending score, to identify patterns that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

### Approach and Methodology
The analysis began with an exploration of the distribution of individual attributes to gain insights into the customer base. Following this, the KMeans clustering algorithm was employed to discover and visualize customer groups. The process involved determining the optimal number of clusters through the elbow method, ensuring the most meaningful segmentation.

### Key Insights
The clustering resulted in distinct customer groups, each with unique characteristics. The insights gained from these segments include:
- Identification of customer groups with varying levels of income and spending, useful for personalized promotions.
- Age-related trends that correlate with spending behavior, highlighting potential for age-specific marketing approaches.

### Conclusion
This segmentation approach has proven effective for identifying customer groups with distinct characteristics. The insights derived from this analysis can significantly enhance marketing strategies by focusing on the most promising customer segments for engagement and growth.
